*) Workflows:
    -> specify the operation that what you want to achieve  
    -> Workflows are like pipelines
    -> Codify useful, customized process
    -> .yaml syntax
    -> .github/workflows
    -> Action run in VMs (Linux, Win, Mac)
        -> Or Docker on Linux VMs
    -> Log streaming & artifacts
    -> Secret store with each repository or organization

*) Workflow files glue together existing actions in sequence
    -> Listen for particular events
    -> Then run per-existing actions
    -> Or shell scripts

*) EX:
    -> build:
        runs-on :${{ matrix.os }}
        strategy:
            matrix:
                node-version:[8.x, 10.x, 12.x]
                os: [macos-latest, windows-latest, ubuntu-18.04]

    -> Here build will executed nine times, by it wil build for macos for all 3 node version and windows for all 3 node version and so on

*) Starter Workflows:
    -> GitHub Provided starter workflows
    -> Pre configured for specific languages and frameworks 
    -> Suggested workflows based on languages and framework create you own workflows
