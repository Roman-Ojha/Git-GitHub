=> Branches in Git :

	-> Long Running Branch on github
		1. Master/main
		2. develop (for developement purpose and for testing)
		3. release (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX80eKPdA28)
		4. propose update(pu)
		5. prod
	-> git branch = to see the branch of the repo
	-> git branch <branch_Name> (git branch -b <branch_Name>) = to make the new branch of the repo
	-> git branch -v (see list of branch)
	-> git branch -vv (see list of branch)
	-> git branch -M main 
	-> git branch -r (to find name of remote branch)
	-> git branch - (to go to previously working branch)
	-> git checkout <remote_branch_name> (to switch to the remote branch)
	-> git checkout <Branch_Name> = to switch to the another branch of the repo
		-> Note: while switching file will also switch means, all the file from that branch will replace the another branch
	-> git checkout -b <branch_name> (to create new branch)
	-> git merge <another_branch_name> = this will merge the another branch and make one
	-> git push origin --delete <branch_Name> = to delete the branch from the remote(github)

	-> git branch -d <branch_Name> = to delete the branch from the local system
	-> git push origin --delete <remote_branch_name>
	-> git branch -D <branch_Name> = hard delete

*) List out all the branches:
	-> git branch -a (list of remote & local branches)
	-> git branch -r (list of remote branch)
	-> git branch (list of local branch)

*) Rename Branch to local & remote
	-> git checkout <old_name>
	-> git checkout <new_name>
	-> git push origin -u <new_name>
	-> git push origin --delete <old_name>
	
*) Delete local branch deleted branch from remote repo
	-> git remote update --prune (this will delete the reference to your remote repository, if branch don't exist in you remote repository)
		-> EX: on 'git branch -vv' we will see:
			-> <date> 170432 [origin/<date>: gone] <commit_msg>
			-> here : gone means this branch is gone from the remote repo
	-> Now Delete the branch that are 'gone'
		-> git branch -vv | awk '/: gone]/{print $1} | xargs git branch -d
			-> awk & print (search for the given text & print those branch name)
			-> This 3 command will find and delete the gone branch
	-> But you can manually delete all the 'gone' branch as well
