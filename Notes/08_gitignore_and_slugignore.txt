=> Ignoring Files in Git by adding .gitignore file 
	-> touch .gitignore = to make blank .gitignore file
	-> notepad .gitignore = to open file in notepad
	-> git rm --cached <FILENAME> = to not track the file that we use to track bafore and after we add it to the .gitignore
	-> Inside the .gitignore :
		EX: Index.txt
		    *.pyc
		    *.sql
	-> https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files
	-> Book link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2


=> NOTE: we can't git ignore different file in different branch because if we will merge those two branch it will again get all the ingore file into the merged branch
